# CsPistols

Welcome to my CLI app! This app scrapes data for the various pistols in the video game Counter-Strike: Global Offensive and returns detailed information about the weapon's statistics. This is a great utility for newer players to the game who may need longer than the game's 15 second timer to be able to make an informed decision about what they should purchase.

## Installation

Execute:

    $ bundle install

## Usage

To use: Run the cs_pistols file (bin/cs_pistols). You will be given a list of the game's pistol weapons. Select the number next to the pistol to be given the detailed information about the weapon. After getting the information you will be prompted to either re-run the program or end with a Y/N prompt. Enjoy!

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.
