# CsPistols

Welcome to my CLI data gem! This gem scrapes data for the various pistols in the video game Counter-Strike: Global Offensive and returns detailed information about the weapon's statistics. This is a great utility for newer players to the game who may need longer than the game's 15 second timer to be able to make an informed decision about what they should purchase.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'cs_pistols'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install cs_pistols

## Usage

To use: Run the cs_pistols file (bin/cs_pistols). You will be given a list of the game's pistol weapons. Select the number next to the pistol to be given the detailed information about the weapon. After getting the information you will be prompted to either re-run the program or end with a Y/N prompt. Enjoy!

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
